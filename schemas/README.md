## Note on FlutterFlow

These JSON Schema files are maintained separately from FlutterFlow's internal schema.
FlutterFlow manages the Dart schema files in `lib/backend/schema/`.

These JSON schemas serve as:
- Standardized documentation (IETF format)
- Validation schemas for external tools
- Reference for API integrations
